Fuzzy Logic

Conceptual and applied introduction to fuzzy logic, covering fuzzy sets, membership functions, linguistic variables, and real-world applications in healthcare and AI decision-making.

This project demonstrates a complete linear programming optimization workflow implemented in Python. Using NumPy and Matplotlib, the model evaluates all feasible solutions under multiple constraints to guarantee a global optimum.
This project explores fuzzy logic as an extension of Boolean logic, enabling AI systems to handle uncertainty, partial truth, and human-like reasoning. It covers foundational concepts such as fuzzy sets, membership functions, linguistic variables, and fuzzy rule-based systems.

Fuzzy Logic–Based Decision Modelling
Project Report
1. Introduction
This project demonstrates the application of fuzzy logic as an intelligent decision-making framework for handling uncertainty, imprecision, and linguistic reasoning. Unlike classical Boolean logic, fuzzy logic allows partial truth values between 0 and 1, making it suitable for real-world problems where crisp boundaries are unrealistic.
The objective of this study is to design, implement, and evaluate a fuzzy inference system using Python to model decision behaviour based on multiple input variables and rule-based reasoning.
2. Methodology
2.1 Fuzzy Logic Framework
The project follows the standard fuzzy logic pipeline:
1.	Fuzzification
Continuous input variables are transformed into fuzzy sets using membership functions (e.g., low, medium, high).
2.	Rule Base Construction
Linguistic IF–THEN rules are defined to capture expert knowledge and logical relationships between inputs and outputs.
3.	Inference Mechanism
Fuzzy inference is performed by combining rules using logical operators to compute fuzzy outputs.
4.	Defuzzification
The fuzzy output is converted into a crisp numerical value to support decision-making.
2.2 Tools and Technologies
•	Python
•	NumPy
•	scikit-fuzzy
•	Jupyter Notebook
•	Visualization libraries for membership functions and output behaviour
3. Analysis and Results
The fuzzy system successfully models gradual transitions between decision states rather than abrupt thresholds. The membership functions clearly represent linguistic variables, while the rule base demonstrates how complex decisions can be expressed using simple human-readable logic.
Key observations include:
•	Smooth output behaviour across input ranges
•	Robust handling of overlapping input conditions
•	Interpretability of decision rules compared to traditional machine-learning models
The results confirm that fuzzy logic is effective in scenarios where uncertainty, ambiguity, or subjective judgment is present.
4. Discussion
This implementation highlights the strength of fuzzy logic in explainable AI and decision support systems. Unlike black-box models, fuzzy rules provide transparency and can be easily adjusted based on domain expertise.
Potential real-world applications include:
•	Decision support systems
•	Risk assessment
•	Control systems
•	Healthcare and engineering applications
•	Human-centric AI systems
5. Conclusion
This project demonstrates a complete fuzzy logic workflow, from fuzzification to defuzzification, using Python. The system effectively handles imprecision while maintaining interpretability and flexibility. Fuzzy logic remains a powerful approach for intelligent systems where human-like reasoning is required.
