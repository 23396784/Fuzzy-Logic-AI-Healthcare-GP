🏥 Fuzzy Logic AI for Healthcare Decision Support

Linear Programming Optimization
Python-based linear programming optimization demonstrating constraint handling, brute-force search, and visual validation of global optima using NumPy and Matplotlib.

Fuzzy Logic

Conceptual and applied introduction to fuzzy logic, covering fuzzy sets, membership functions, linguistic variables, and real-world applications in healthcare and AI decision-making.

This project demonstrates a complete linear programming optimization workflow implemented in Python. Using NumPy and Matplotlib, the model evaluates all feasible solutions under multiple constraints to guarantee a global optimum.
This project explores fuzzy logic as an extension of Boolean logic, enabling AI systems to handle uncertainty, partial truth, and human-like reasoning. It covers foundational concepts such as fuzzy sets, membership functions, linguistic variables, and fuzzy rule-based systems.

Real-world applications are discussed across:

Healthcare decision support systems

Medical diagnosis and imaging

Traffic control and climate systems

AI-assisted literature review systems

The project emphasizes interpretability, ethical AI, and decision transparency, particularly in healthcare contexts.

Key Concepts: Fuzzy Sets, Membership Functions, Linguistic Variables, Interpretable AI
